- Added `.gitignore` — Excludes `.venv/`
- Ran `ruff --fix` — Auto-fixed 133 lint issues across Python codebase:
  - `Optional[X]` → `X | None` (modern syntax)
  - `from typing import Callable` → `from collections.abc import Callable`
  - Removed unused imports, sorted imports, prefixed unused vars with `_`
- Created local `.venv` for Pyright/Zed IDE support

**Files Created**: 8 new files
**Files Modified**: 25+ Python/JS/CSS files
**Files Deleted**: 4 vanilla JS component files

### Session 19: 2026-01-26 — KNXSim Wall Switch Support

**Goal:** Add interactive wall switch controls and fix shared GA handling

**Wall Switch Controls** (`sim/knxsim/static/`):
- Added push button controls to Edit Mode panel for template devices
- `toggleButton()` — Toggle button state and send command via shared GA
- `getButtonGAs()` — Extract button GAs from device for UI rendering
- `guessDPT()` — Recognises `button_*` and `led_*` patterns → returns "1.001"

**Shared GA Fix** (`sim/knxsim/devices/template_device.py`):
- Changed `_ga_info` from `dict[int, tuple]` to `dict[int, list[tuple]]`
- Multiple buttons sharing same GA now all update when telegram arrives
- Structure: `{ga: [(slot_name, field, dpt, direction), ...]}`

**API & Manager Fixes**:
- `api/routes_devices.py` — Updated to handle new `_ga_info` list structure
- `core/premise_manager.py` — Added `_parse_ga()` inline (was importing non-existent module)
- `core/premise_manager.py` — `update_device()` rebuilds `_ga_info` for live GA editing

**Files Modified**: 6 files (`template_device.py`, `routes_devices.py`, `premise_manager.py`, `index.html`, `store.js`, `style.css`)

**Result**: Wall switches work in Edit Mode — pressing button_1 or button_2 sends telegram to shared GA, all linked buttons and lights update correctly.

### Session 20: 2026-02-01 — KNXSim Topology Restructure Phase 1

**Goal:** Add proper KNX topology (Area/Line/Device) alongside building view (Floor/Room)

**Backend — Schema & Migration** (`sim/knxsim/persistence/db.py`):
- New `areas` table: id, premise_id, area_number (0-15), name, description
- New `lines` table: id, area_id, line_number (0-15), name, description
- Added `line_id`, `device_number` columns to `devices`
- Auto-migration: parses existing individual_address → creates topology
- `ensure_topology_for_ia()` auto-creates Area/Line when IA provided

**Backend — API Endpoints** (`sim/knxsim/api/routes_topology.py`):
- `GET /premises/{id}/topology` — Full tree (Areas → Lines → Devices)
- CRUD for `/premises/{id}/areas/*` and `/areas/{id}/lines/*`
- Duplicate area_number/line_number detection (409 Conflict)

**Backend — Reference API** (`sim/knxsim/api/routes_reference.py`):
- `/reference/individual-address` — IA structure guide
- `/reference/ga-structure` — GA hierarchy patterns
- `/reference/flags` — Communication flags (CRWTUI) documentation
- `/reference/dpts` — Complete DPT catalog (50+ types, categorized)
- `/reference/device-templates` — Recommended GAs by device type

**Frontend — View Switcher** (`sim/knxsim/static/`):
- New view switcher tabs: "🏠 Building View" | "🔌 Topology View"
- Building View: Existing Floor/Room layout unchanged
- Topology View: Collapsible tree of Areas → Lines → Devices

**Frontend — Topology View**:
- Area cards with expand/collapse, line count
- Line headers with device count, expand/collapse
- Device rows showing: IA, icon, name, type, room assignment
- Engineer Mode: Add/Edit/Delete buttons for Areas, Lines
- Add Device button on each line with suggested IA

**Frontend — Reference Store** (`sim/knxsim/static/js/store.js`):
- `$store.reference` — DPT catalog, device templates, GA/IA helpers
- `searchDpts(query)` — Search DPTs by id/name/use_case
- `suggestNextIA(areaLine)` — Suggest next device number on line
- `suggestNextGA(mainMiddle)` — Suggest next GA in group
- `getDevicesByLine()` — Group devices for reference panel

**Frontend — Device Modal Help Panel**:
- Tabbed interface: Recommended | All Devices | All GAs | IA Help | GA Help | DPTs | Flags
- "Suggest" button for Individual Address
- Reference data from backend loaded on demand

**Files Created**: 5 (`routes_topology.py`, `routes_reference.py`, `TOPOLOGY-RESTRUCTURE.md`, `CODEBASE.md`, `alpine-collapse.min.js`)
**Files Modified**: 12 (db.py, app.py, store.js, api.js, index.html, style.css, and others)
**Total Lines Added**: ~4,300

**Result**: Phase 1 complete — Topology schema, API, and UI working. Devices auto-migrated to topology on startup.

### Session 21: 2026-02-03 — ETS Import, Admin UI & KNXSim Thermostats

**Goal:** Commissioning workflow and realistic climate simulation

**ETS Import Commissioning** (`internal/commissioning/etsimport/`):
- Created ETS 5/6 XML parser for .knxproj files
- Device detection with confidence scoring (80%+ match threshold)
- 3-level GroupRange hierarchy for room extraction
- Auto-create locations (areas/rooms) from imported topology
- Suggested room pre-populated in Flutter import UI
- 6 files: parser.go, types.go, detection.go, errors.go, doc.go + tests

**Admin Interface** (`code/ui/admin/`):
- New admin UI with 4 tabs: Metrics, Devices, Import, Discovery
- Discovery tab shows KNX bus scan data from GA Recorder
- Import tab for ETS project file upload

**GA Recorder** (`internal/bridges/knx/ga_recorder.go`):
- Records group address traffic with timestamps
- Replaces BusMonitor for commissioning discovery
- Integrates with health check cycling

**KNXSim Thermostats** (`sim/knxsim/devices/thermostat.py`):
- Room thermostat with internal PID controller
- Valve actuator control output (0-100%)
- Setpoint adjustment via KNX commands
- Thermal simulation scenario for realistic heating behaviour
- Valve percentage display on heating actuator channels

**KNXSim Enhancements**:
- 28 new device templates added
- Multi-channel actuator LED indicators
- Loads system for physical equipment simulation
- Channel state synchronisation improvements
- Collapsible telegram inspector
- Template browser layout improvements

**Flutter Panel Improvements**:

- Thermostat tile UI with setpoint control
- Auto-detect API host for embedded panel
- Room selection from suggested_room

**Files Created**: 10+ (commissioning package, admin UI, GA recorder)
**Files Modified**: 30+ across Go, Flutter, Python
**Commits**: 75 since last changelog entry

### Session 17: 2026-01-25 — KNXSim Engineer UI & Sync Fixes

**Goal:** Complete KNXSim Engineer UI and fix bidirectional state synchronisation

**KNXSim Enhancements** (`sim/knxsim/`):
- **Engineer UI** with interactive device controls:
  - Light switches: ON/OFF toggle button
  - Dimmers: brightness slider (0-100%)
  - Blinds: position + slat angle sliders
  - Presence sensors: motion trigger button + lux slider (0-2000 lx)
  - Sensors: temperature display
- **Telegram Inspector**: Live bus traffic via WebSocket
- **Device Panel**: GA table with auto-detected DPT types, raw state JSON
- **Command API**: `POST /devices/{id}/command` now sends KNX telegrams on bus

**Critical Sync Fixes**:
- **KNXSim command → KNX telegram**: Commands now call `_send_telegram_with_hook()` to broadcast on bus (was only updating internal state)
- **Core state merge**: Changed SQLite `SET state = ?` to `json_patch()` — fields now accumulate instead of overwriting
- **Registry cache merge**: Cache update merges state fields instead of replacing entire state
- **Multi-response telegrams**: Dimmers return both `switch_status` AND `brightness_status` (like real KNX devices)
- **UI toggle refresh**: `updateState()` now calls `_renderControls()` to update button state

**Files Modified**:
- `sim/knxsim/static/js/components/device-panel.js` — Presence controls, slider suffix fix
- `sim/knxsim/api/routes_devices.py` — presence/lux commands, DPT9 encoding
- `sim/knxsim/devices/light_dimmer.py` — Return list of response telegrams
- `sim/knxsim/core/premise.py` — Handle list of cEMI responses
- `sim/knxsim/knxip/server.py` — Send multiple response telegrams
- `code/core/internal/device/repository.go` — json_patch for state merge
- `code/core/internal/device/registry.go` — Merge state in cache

**Documentation**:
- Updated `sim/knxsim/VISION.md` — Phase 2.3, 2.4 marked complete
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` — Version 1.0.9 entry

**Result**: Full bidirectional sync working: Flutter ↔ Core ↔ KNXSim
