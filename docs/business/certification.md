## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to be an electrician?**
A: Yes. UK electrical qualifications (17th/18th Edition or equivalent) are mandatory. Gray Logic is professional automation that requires proper installation.

**Q: Can I install without certification?**
A: The software is open source, so technically yes. However, you cannot use Gray Logic branding, purchase hardware at discount, or be listed as an installer.

**Q: What if I fail the assessment?**
A: You can retake within 30 days at reduced fee (£200). Additional support is available.

**Q: Is there an exam?**
A: The assessment is practical, not written. You demonstrate competence by completing a configuration task.

**Q: Can I become certified outside the UK?**
A: Not initially. EU expansion planned for Year 7+. Contact us for international interest.

**Q: What if I only want to do small projects?**
A: Level 1 certification is suitable for any project size. Higher levels are for those wanting leads and advanced benefits.

**Q: How many installers per area?**
A: We aim for reasonable geographic distribution. Excessive overlap would be discussed before acceptance.
