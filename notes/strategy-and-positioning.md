## 1. Core Vision & USP

Gray Logic Stack is **not** another cloud-dependent smart home gadget ecosystem.  

It is a **future-proof rewire platform** that replaces traditional electrical installations with open-standards KNX + a mandatory local Gray Logic Core.

**Primary USP**:

- Every home gets a **real local brain** (Gray Logic Core) from day one — not just wiring waiting for future smarts.
- Offline-first: 99%+ functionality without internet.
- No vendor lock-in: open KNX at field layer, GPL license, customer owns everything.
- Physical controls & safety always work — even if Core is down.
- Modular mix-and-match upgrades: add features later with minimal (but honest) disruption.

**Core Promise to Customer**:

"Rewire once, smart forever. Start basic, upgrade anytime — without selling your privacy or data to big tech."

## 2. Target Market Segments

| Segment                  | Property Value       | Typical Customer Profile                          | Job Value Range | % of Revenue Target |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Basic / Mid-Market       | £300k–£750k          | Families, first-time smart buyers, energy-conscious | £12k–£18k       | 50–60%              |
| Higher-End Average       | £750k–£1.5M          | Paid-off mortgage, disposable income, 4–5 beds     | £18k–£30k       | 30–40%              |
| Luxury / Estates         | £1.5M–£10M+          | High-net-worth, multi-building, "everything"       | £50k–£200k+     | 10–20%              |
| Business / Light Commercial | £500k–£5M+         | Small offices, shops, farms                        | £20k–£100k      | 5–10% (add-on)      |

## 3. Mandatory Gray Logic Core in Every Install

**Decision**: Every job includes the Gray Logic Core + central touchscreen.

**Why**:

- Turns "smart-ready" into "smart from day one".
- Provides instant value (timers, room control, energy view).
- Creates natural upsell path (Core already there → add voice/sensors/CCTV later).
- Differentiates from dumb rewires and cloud junk.

**Base Inclusions** (every home):

- KNX bus + relays/actuators for key loads
- Gray Logic Core (local Go binary, SQLite/MQTT)
- Wall touchscreen (basic control: timers, on/off, scenes)
- Basic local services: timers, energy dashboard, simple automation

## 4. Modular Mix-and-Match Upsell Pathway

| Tier / Add-On Group      | Approx Add-On Cost | Key Features                                      | Disruption Level | Energy Saving Potential |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Essentials               | £2k–£5k            | Proximity sensors, basic app, timers              | Low (plug-in)    | 10–20%                   |
| Comfort                  | £5k–£10k           | Voice (local), custom heating zones (plumber), music zones | Medium (some wiring) | 20–35%                   |
| Premium                  | £10k–£20k          | Security/fire, CCTV, access control               | Medium–High      | 30–40%                   |
| Estate / Full Luxury     | £20k–£100k+        | Redundant Core, full AI, AV matrix, pools/garages | High (multi-bus) | 40–60%                   |

**Honest Disruption Reality**:

- Most software/sensor upgrades: no walls opened.
- New wired KNX devices or heating zones in unprepared rooms: walls likely opened (chasing cables).
- Marketing line: "Most upgrades plug right in. For full wired expansion later, we can add drops with minimal mess — same as any traditional upgrade."

## 5. Energy Savings & Plumber Partnership Angle

**Core Pitch**: "Save 20–40% on energy bills (£300–£800/year) with intelligent zoning, timers, and AI — without cloud spying."

**Heating Upsell**:

- Partner with local plumbers for multiport valve setups (per-room/zone control).
- Cost: £1.5k–£4k add-on (plumber labor + valves).
- Gray Logic coordinates via KNX + app/voice/AI.
- Savings: 20–30% on gas (big in NL winters).

## 6. Marketing Narrative & Story

**Headline Story**: "Alexa pissed me off so much I built this."

**Key Messages**:

- "No more cloud-dependent crap. Gray Logic is local, private, and forever."
- "Rewire once, smart forever. Every home gets a real brain from day one."
- "Start basic. Add voice, sensors, CCTV, music — whenever you want."
- "Save hundreds on bills while keeping your data yours."

**Channels**:

- Showcase home videos (YouTube/LinkedIn): before/after, Alexa rant, energy savings proof.
- Local Facebook groups, trade shows (VSK), LinkedIn ads targeting homeowners/electricians.
- Plumber partnerships for heating upsells.

## 7. Next Actions / Milestones

- Finalize base package spec (Core + touchscreen mandatory).
- Create customer-facing pricing/upsell sheet.
- Draft installer training outline.
- Plan showcase home video series.
- Identify 1–2 trusted electricians for pilot discussions.
